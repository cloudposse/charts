# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This is the Geodesic microservices distribution of Helm charts for Kubernetes.

  Geodesic is the fastest way to get up and running with a rock solid, production grade cloud platform. Use [standalone our shell](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic/) to get started quickly and avoid dependency hell. It ships with support for [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/), [Kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/), [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/) and [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/).

  What makes this distribution special is we've developed these charts to integrate with third party services like Github for authentication (OAuth2) and Duo for MFA.

quickstart: |-
  ## How do I install these charts?

  After enabling the repositories mentioned above, just run `helm install cloudposse-incubator/$chart`.

  Currently, most of the charts are located in the `incubator/` directory until they reach greater maturity.
